## 📖 Introduction

### Background
Writing a PhD thesis is one of the most challenging aspects of doctoral studies. As a fourth-year PhD candidate, I've experienced these challenges firsthand and want to share the systematic approach my supervisor taught me to make the process more manageable and effective.

### Common Challenges
- **Where to start?** Writing lengthy thesis chapters can feel overwhelming
- **What to write?** Uncertainty about content and structure
- **Learning from others:** While reading other theses provides insight, the preparation process isn't always clear
- **The importance of preparation:** Good preparation is crucial for guiding the entire writing process

## 🎯 The 6-Step Method

My supervisor developed this systematic approach to address the common challenges in thesis writing:

### Step 1: Draft Your Abstract
📝 Create a preliminary abstract that outlines your research

### Step 2: Develop Key Questions
❓ Write up a comprehensive list of research questions

### Step 3: Create Visual Materials
📊 Transform important questions into slides and create supporting figures

### Step 4: Build the Framework
🏗️ Start with a thesis template and integrate your abstract, questions, and figures

### Step 5: Point-Form Responses
📋 For each question, develop responses in bullet-point format

### Step 6: Expand and Elaborate
📖 Transform your bullet points into complete sentences and paragraphs

## 🚀 How to Use This Tutorial

### Getting Started
1. **Follow the sequence:** Work through steps 1-6 in order
2. **Use the folders:** Each step has a dedicated tutorial folder with detailed guidance
3. **Iterate continuously:** Refine your writing throughout the entire process

> **💡 Pro Tip:** This is an iterative process. Don't expect perfection on the first pass—continuous refinement is key to success!
